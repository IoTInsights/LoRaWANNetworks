# LoRaWANNetworks

The examples in this repository are from the book [IoT Networks with LoRaWAN](https://leanpub.com/iot-networks-with-lorawan) which is still a work in progress but already available at the LeanPub publishing site. You can already buy it now to help my buy some pizza while still working on it. You will get it a a lower introductory price and can download the update of the book as it gets finished.

If you have come across this repository from somewhere else and find it helpful, please consider buying this book because it contains a lot of additional background information which will help you to get the most out of the LoRa(WAN) technology.
